### Packages are not supposed to be self tested.

A better import mechanism proposal.    
"The only use case seems to be running scripts that happen to be living inside a module's directory, which I've always seen as an antipattern." (see it on [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6323860/sibling-package-imports))

## (never ending) \todo
 * better understand packages 
    is __init__.py there only for the paths ?

 * Python docstring vs multi-line comments

## tags
 * tag_learn_python
 * tag_class_python
 * tag_tree_class : a tree class (nodes, description, cost)
