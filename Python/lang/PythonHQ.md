### Packages are not supposed to be self tested.

A better import mechanism proposal.    
"The only use case seems to be running scripts that happen to be living inside a module's directory, which I've always seen as an antipattern."

## (never ending) \todo
 * better understand packages 
    is __init__.py there only for the paths ?

 * Python docstring vs multi-line comments

## References
 * tag_python
